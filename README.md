# Music Maker
 A game made in python using PyGame, that allows the user to compose music. 
 
 There is a grid of buttons that you can select to choose a specific note. In each collumn, there are 12 buttons each of which represent one of the 12 notes. Once you have selected the notes and order of the notes, you press the play button to listen to your music.
 
 Tested on the following platforms:
  1. Windows 10, Python 3.7, PyGame 1.9.6
  2. macOS Mojave, Python 3.7, PyGame 2.0.0.dev4

If you download this game make sure you have PyGame as well as Python installed on your computer. The systems configurations that this game have been tested on are listed above. Also, make sure to see the stability of the release, that you download. If it is listed as unstable it is likely to have many bugs in it code, it does however have lots of new work-in-progress features! I however would sugest you to get the most newest (but stable!) release.
